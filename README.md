# AgentForge

**Decentralized AI Agent Infrastructure on SVM Chain**

AgentForge is a comprehensive platform for creating, publishing, and executing AI agents in a decentralized, trustless environment. Built on CARV SVM Chain, it provides modular identity, reputation systems, and verifiable data orchestration for enterprise and DeSci applications.

## üîß Key Components

### 1. AI Agent Upload and Publishing
- **Intuitive Interface**: AgentForge provides an intuitive interface to upload and describe AI agent scripts.
- **Off-Chain Storage**: Scripts can be off-chain stored (e.g., IPFS) and linked with metadata such as task type, requirements, language, and tags.
- **On-Chain Anchoring**: Each agent is anchored on-chain via a smart contract and linked to the developer's CARV ID using ERC-7231.
- **Versioning & Licensing**: Versioning and licensing can be integrated, giving creators control over usage rights.

### 2. CARV Identity & Reputation
- **Modular Identity**: Every creator and buyer is identified using CARV ID, which enables modular identity and reputation tracking.
- **Reputation Building**: Successful agent executions, peer reviews, and purchases contribute to the reputation score.
- **Agent Reputation**: Agents themselves can also accumulate a reputation based on deployment history and consumer feedback.

### 3. Marketplace Discovery
- **Categorized Browsing**: Users can browse agents by category (e.g., LLM wrappers, scrapers, validators), use case (DeSci, DeFi, NFT curation), or reputation.
- **Detailed Agent Pages**: Detailed agent pages show script metadata, usage guide, creator identity, price (if commercial), reputation, and past activity.
- **Usage Models**: Agents can be tagged for open-source, freemium, or license-based usage.

### 4. Trustless Execution & Orchestration (Tarcdin + DATA)
- **ZK-Verified Environment**: For sensitive or verifiable workflows, agents can run in a zk-verified or TEE-backed environment on the SVM chain (Tarcdin).
- **DATA Framework Integration**: Integration with the DATA framework allows agents to authenticate and operate on verified data, on-chain or off-chain.
- **Trusted Outcomes**: This ensures that agent outcomes can be trusted, especially in enterprise, DAO governance, and DeSci workflows.

### 5. Monetization & Licensing
- **Flexible Pricing**: Creators can choose to make agents free, subscription-based, or pay-per-call.
- **Smart Contract Management**: Smart contracts handle licensing, payment splits, and enforce usage rules.
- **Transparent Analytics**: AgentForge provides transparent logs of agent calls, uptime, success/failure rates, and revenue earned.

| üß† **AI Agent Infrastructure on SVM Chain**                     | AI agents run natively on SVM Chain to verify, curate, and audit datasets and model training. Each agent acts autonomously, with execution verified by zk and TEE. |
| ü™™ **Modular Identity & Reputation with CARV ID (ERC-7231)**    | Every agent and human has a composable identity. Reputation grows based on task success, trustworthiness, and training outcomes ‚Äî traceable across chains.         |
| üß© **Decentralized Data Orchestration with D.A.T.A. Framework** | All data (on/off-chain) is authenticated through the D.A.T.A. layer, tagged and trusted using EAS, zk proofs, and TEEs.                                            |
| üåê **Open Innovation: AI √ó Web3 for Real World Use Cases**      | Enables verifiable, privacy-preserving collaboration between humans and AI for enterprise, DeSci, and open research data curation.                                 |
